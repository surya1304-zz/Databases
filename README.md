# Databases

# Use the File Names for the Database Names. It's mandatory.

Another Note These should be in the localhost i.e., 127.0.0.1

The Username should be **_root_** And password should be **_password_**

else you need to change in the server.js file in the Server folder of the project.

And In other case, The Server would run fine....

Note That the PHPmyAdmin doesnot give permission for the other IP address to access the databases. To make it give the localhost i.e., **127.0.0.1/3000** to access the databases in configuration file of PHPmyAdmin.
It is also mandatory.....
